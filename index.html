						Hi, I am Jacopo, a student in Computer Science and Engineering.
                        I am currently getting my master’s degree at Verona University.
                        In the meantime, I’m also a student research assistant at Altair Robotics Lab, where I’m developing some
                        computer vision solutions for medical images that will be integrated on a medical robot.
                        In the future I hope to see my software in hospitals all around the world!
						</p>
                        <p class="block">
                        As you can see from this page, my main interests are not in design and frontend development,
                        I’m more of a backend/algorithms type of guy: the languages I use more are Python and C++,
                        but I also know Java and some Kotlin. I’m all for OOP but sometimes I use some functional style tricks.
                        I am especially happy when I see that the code I wrote is concise, clean and readable.
                        </p>
                        <p class="block">
                        My bachelor thesis was in deep learning (for medical images) and my master thesis will be about improvements
                        in solving CMAPD, a planning and optimization computer science problem.
                        </p>
                        <p class="block">
                        In the future I’d love to work for a company that produces useful and impactful software,
                        but I haven’t thought of a specific area yet, I’m open minded about that!
                        I would be super happy if I could contribute to make your software better.
                        </p>
