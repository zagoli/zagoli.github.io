			Hi, I am Jacopo, and I just got my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
			My bachelor thesis was in deep learning for medical images, and my master thesis was about using an attention model
			to solve the task assignment problem of CMAPD, a planning and optimization computer science problem.

			Rigth now, I'm working as a software engineer for Asem S.r.l..
			Previously, I was a student research assistant at the ALTAIR Robotics Lab, where I helped to develop some
			computer vision solutions for medical images that will be integrated on a medical robot called PROST.

			If you can't tell from the design of this page, I'm more interested in back-end or system programming than front-end development:
			the languages I use most are C++, Python, Java and object-oriented languages in general.
			I am also always trying to improve my coding style and skills:
			I've read <em>Clean Code</em> by Robert C. Martin (although I don't agree with some of it) and
			now I'm reading <em>Working Effectively with Legacy Code</em> by Michael C. Feathers.
